# Script

...is meant to mimic the thought process.  
My very own custom mix of external brain, task management, calendar, project management and note taking app.

the sequence below is the foundation for the idea
brain | script | keyboard
-- | - | -
a thought starts as few words | create note | `CTRL N`
soon other related thoughts join | create grouped notes | `CTRL G`
usually it grows into an idea | expand note into document | `CTRL E`
originates many other thoughts | create nested notes | `CTRL .`
sometimes grows further into a whole project | expand note to list, board or project | `CTRL E`
but other times it just gets rejected | delete note | `CTRL D`
or even forgotten on the back of the mind | archive note | `CTRL M`
